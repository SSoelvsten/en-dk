# Technical Dictionary for Computer Science

Danish students tend to speak  Danglish when discussing computer science in their native language. This tiny static webpage provides a dictionary to amend this gap in their vocabulary. Of course, this is in part made as a joke - but, only in parts...

## Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Contributions

The dictionary is not complete. The scope of this page can also be extended, e.g. by adding more languages and features. Any contributions of either kind is very welcome!
